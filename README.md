# Image-Manipulation-Experiments
Project to implement different algorithms for digital image manipulation.

A bitmap image of a tiger was read in Java and had its RGB data read. The RGB data was then manipulated to produce a mirrored image, a color inverted image, a black and white image, and a vertically stretched image. I did these experiments to better understand how image editing software could be programmed.

# Running the Project
Ideally all the program must be imported into a Java IDE for running. The created PPM images and PGM image can be opened in Libre Office Draw or any other software that supports the file formats.
